## Features

- Every task has a **README.md** which tells the usage, and a **report.md** which tells the details of implementation
- All tasks share the same highly structured code framework which is easier to learn
- All tasks have been tested successfully in both local and Colab
- With or without gpu is just fine

## Dependency

Local：pytorch1.8.1

Colab：pytorch1.11.0+cu113
